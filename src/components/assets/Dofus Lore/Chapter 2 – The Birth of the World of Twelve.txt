After the fall of the Eliatropes and the silence of the Dragons, the world lay broken — wild, shapeless, and raw. But from that formless chaos rose a spark of divine will.

Where once the gods had watched silently, now they stepped forth. They were twelve, each embodying a force, a style, a flaw, and a strength of mortal nature. These were not gods of creation, but gods of guidance — and sometimes, mischief.

 The Pantheon of Twelve

Each god claimed a part of the world and began shaping followers in their image. These were the first mortals, crafted not from stone or magic, but from the gods' dreams and flaws.

Each god blessed their followers with unique powers — abilities that mirrored their own. These blessings gave rise to the 12 original classes, each a reflection of divine will.
