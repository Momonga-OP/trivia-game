Before clocks ticked and stars blinked in the night sky, there was only the dance of two forces: Wakfu and Stasis. One pulsed with life, movement, and change — the breath of creation. The other sat still, silent, cold — the weight of stillness. Together, they were the breath and bones of the universe.

In this timeless sea was born the Eliatrope people, wise beings gifted with immortality and deep connection to Wakfu. With them came the Dragons, majestic creatures forged of pure elemental power. Each Dragon was bound to an Eliatrope child — twin souls, sharing fate across lifetimes.

Together, they built a civilization unlike any before or since — towering cities of crystal and floating islands powered by Wakfu veins. Peace reigned, but peace is never eternal. From the stars fell enemies made of logic and metal: the Mechasms, beings who saw the Eliatropes as a threat to the cosmic balance.

What followed was war — beautiful, terrifying, and endless.

To protect their legacy, the Eliatropes fled through dimensions, and their civilization faded like a dream. Only a few remained, sleeping in hidden sanctuaries... waiting. In their wake, the world healed. From its ashes rose new gods, and a new world — the World of Twelve.

But deep beneath the earth, sleeping in the belly of time, the Primordial Dofus — six sacred dragon eggs — stirred with power.

And so begins the true story...
