Beneath the soil of the newborn world… in caverns untouched by light… six eggs pulsed with a quiet, ancient power.

They were not ordinary eggs. They shimmered with the very essence of creation. They were Dofus — the Primordial Dofus, each laid by a Dragon of immense elemental power. Unlike any artifact before or since, they did not simply grant strength. They rewrote the rules of reality.

 The Six Primordial Dofus

These were the names that would echo through history:

Emerald Dofus (Aerafal): Said to grant vitality, eternal youth, and the power of wind.

Crimson Dofus (Ignemikhal): Burns with the flame of passion and destruction.

Turquoise Dofus (Aguabrial): Brings clarity, speed, and the whisper of fate.

Ivory Dofus (Dardondakal): Bestows protection and divine light, shielding from harm.

Ebony Dofus (Grougalorasalar): Dark and mysterious, it manipulates shadows and secrets.

Ochre Dofus (Terrakourial): Pulses with raw energy, strengthening the body and spirit.

Each egg was a fragment of its Dragon parent, infused with their nature. To possess one was to hold part of a god… and the world took notice.

 The Age of Seekers

As whispers of the Dofus spread, adventurers became Seekers. Kings and warlords waged wars for a single scale. Cults formed, believing the eggs could bring about salvation — or the end.

The Dofus were scattered, either hidden by their creators, stolen by demons, or sealed in trials designed to break the unworthy. Heroes died chasing them. Entire empires rose and fell over false eggs. And yet, the true Primordials endured — somewhere.

 The Guardians of the Dofus

Not all Dragons vanished. Some took human form and walked among mortals to protect their eggs. Among them were Grougaloragran and Baltazar, powerful Dragons who watched the world with sorrow and hope.

Others hid or fought amongst themselves, torn by the fate of their kind and the danger of the Dofus falling into the wrong hands.

It was said that gathering all six Primordial Dofus would grant a being divine power — the ability to change the world, bend life and death, even challenge the gods. Many sought this... and one succeeded.

But that tale belongs to another chapter.
