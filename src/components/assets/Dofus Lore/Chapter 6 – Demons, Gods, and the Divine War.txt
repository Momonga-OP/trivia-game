“When gods dream, worlds are born.
When demons wake, those worlds burn.”

Long before the first adventurer set foot in Astrub, before the first Dofus gleamed with power, and even before mortals had names… the world was nothing but chaos and silence.

In that void, two forces emerged — not born, but simply were.
One was Order, radiant and serene, giving form to the formless.
The other was Chaos, wild and eternal, devouring what could not defend itself.

From Order came the gods, majestic beings of thought and purpose.
From Chaos came the demons, howling creatures of hunger and fire.

They could not share the same space — not then, not ever.
So, in their eternal opposition, a third space was torn open — a fragile balance between light and dark.
A realm where laws could be bent, yet patterns still formed.
That space was called the Krosmoz.
And within the Krosmoz… was born the World of Twelve.

At first, it was nothing but dust and energy. But soon, twelve divine beings arrived — gods whose powers shaped the stars and soil.
They gave birth to civilizations: bold Iops, sharp Cras, wise Eniripsas, sneaky Srams, and all the rest.
Each race was a reflection of its god’s will — living tools in a cosmic game of influence.

But peace is a myth even the gods could not keep.
Pride grew. Rivalries burned. Jealousies festered.

When Goddess Sacrier bled for mortals and defied her kin…
When God Xelor tampered with time and fate…
When God Ecaflip gambled away divine secrets to unknown forces…
The gods began to turn against each other.

Whispers of war spread not only in heaven… but deep below.

In the Shustuft Crust, the realm of demons, the chaos stirred.
The greatest among them — Rushu, Lord of Destruction — saw the weakness of the gods and smiled.

He built an empire of bones and flame, bred horrors in his forges, and sent his minions crawling into the mortal world through forbidden portals and cursed scrolls.
He offered power to greedy mortals… and they accepted it.

The first demon pact was signed in blood.

The world trembled.
Divine war began.

God fought god. Demon invaded sanctuary.
The World of Twelve, once young and growing, became a battlefield.

Mountains shattered. Rivers boiled.
Entire civilizations disappeared from history — swallowed by the divine storm.

And in the middle of all this… stood mortals.
Small, fragile, and easily broken.
Yet… they adapted.

Some became paladins of gods, fighting for divine justice.
Others served demons, in exchange for promises of power.
And a few stood alone — not as pawns, but as players in their own right.

The gods began to fear them.
The demons began to hunt them.
And the world… began to change.

To this day, the divine war continues.
Not always with fire and lightning — but in secret cults, ancient artifacts, and long-forgotten ruins.

You, adventurer, were born into this world of gods and demons.
And whether you follow the path of light, or chase the shadows…
You carry the mark of a war that began before time itself.

And it has not ended yet.
