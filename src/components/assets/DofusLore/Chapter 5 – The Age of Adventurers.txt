The gods watched in silence. The demons gathered in shadows. The dragons disappeared.

And in the middle of it all, the people of the World of Twelve… adapted.

After the great flood brought on by Ogrest’s tears, the world was never the same. Mountains became islands. Kingdoms crumbled. Magic surged chaotically through the land. But from the ashes of despair rose a new era — the Age of Adventurers.

 Rebirth of the World of Twelve

The World of Twelve refers to the twelve gods that created mortals. Each god gave birth to a people, with their own cultures, values, and combat styles:

| God          | People           | Traits                        |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Iop**      | Warriors         | Bravery, brawn, hot-headed    |
| **Cra**      | Archers          | Precision, discipline, focus  |
| **Eniripsa** | Healers          | Compassion, magic, protection |
| **Sadida**   | Doll masters     | Nature, strategy, empathy     |
| **Sram**     | Assassins        | Stealth, deception, vengeance |
| **Xelor**    | Time mages       | Control, knowledge, foresight |
| **Osamodas** | Summoners        | Loyalty, command of beasts    |
| **Ecaflip**  | Gamblers         | Luck, chaos, fate             |
| **Enutrof**  | Treasure hunters | Greed, cunning, endurance     |
| **Feca**     | Shield bearers   | Wisdom, defense, order        |
| **Sacrier**  | Blood knights    | Pain, sacrifice, devotion     |
| **Pandawa**  | Drunken brawlers | Flow, humor, adaptability     |


These classes are not just warriors. They are descendants of the gods, and each carries part of divine essence.

 Cities, Nations, and Guilds

After the floodwaters receded, new kingdoms and cities emerged:

Bonta: A city of justice and light, ruled by order and noble ideals.

Brâkmar: Its rival, born from fire and chaos, fueled by ambition and conflict.

Astrub: A neutral haven where adventurers from all backgrounds begin their journeys.

Sufokia, Frigost, Amakna, Pandala… each region holds secrets, ruins, and ancient power.

New guilds formed, bound by honor, greed, or friendship. Adventurers took up arms not just for gold, but to understand the past, protect their world, or seek the truth behind Ogrest, the Dofus, and even the gods.

 You Are the Legacy

Every player in the world of Dofus is a part of this legacy.

You are not just a fighter — you are a Seeker, a protector, a challenger to fate. The gods have chosen to remain distant, watching from beyond… but your journey fills the void.

Whether you seek the Dofus for glory, to stop Ogrest’s tears, or simply to build a name for yourself — this is your world now.
