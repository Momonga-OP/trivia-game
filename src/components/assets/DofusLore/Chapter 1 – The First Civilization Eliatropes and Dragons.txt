Long before mortals learned to wield magic or speak the names of gods, the skies were carved by creatures older than memory: the Dragons. Beside them walked a people whose wisdom touched the stars — the Eliatropes.

The Eliatropes were unlike any other race. Born with glowing tattoos and eyes that shimmered with Wakfu, they were ageless beings, reborn each time they died, always retaining their memories. They shared a mystical bond with the Dragons, to whom they were eternally linked.

Each Dragon and each Eliatrope twin were halves of a single soul. Where the Eliatropes brought ideas and harmony, the Dragons brought raw elemental power — fire, air, water, earth, and beyond.

Together, they created a civilization of peace and balance. Towering spires floated above oceans of cloud, powered by Wakfu. Portals connected distant lands. Their capital, Emrub, shone with golden light and living crystals. For centuries, this harmony endured.

But peace, like glass, can shatter with the smallest crack.

**The War with the Mechasms**

The harmony of the Eliatropes drew the attention of distant entities — the Mechasms, beings of perfect order and unfeeling reason. They came not from another world, but from another reality, one where life had no place.

Seeing Wakfu as a chaotic force, they declared war upon the Eliatropes. Their weapons were machines powered by anti-Wakfu, their soldiers endless, their judgment final.

The sky turned red. Islands fell from the heavens. Dragons roared, and the ground cracked beneath the battle of elements and logic.

In a final act of desperation, the Eliatrope Council opened a dimensional gate and sealed away many of their own in a sanctuary hidden beyond space and time. Few remained to continue the fight.

The world they had nurtured burned... and was reborn.
