Power doesn’t always corrupt. Sometimes, it breaks the heart.

His name was Ogrest, a being born not of man or god, but of alchemy. Created by the legendary alchemist Otomaï, Ogrest was a homunculus, a living being molded by science, magic… and hope.

But Ogrest was not a monster. He was gentle, kind-hearted, and curious about the world. Despite his size and strange appearance, he yearned for love. And he found it — or thought he did.

 Ogrest and Dathura

Her name was Dathura, a Sadida doll brought to life, a work of enchantment and grace. To Ogrest, she was the sun. She treated him like no one else ever had — not with fear or mockery, but with laughter and warmth.

To win her love, Ogrest sought the greatest treasures in existence: the Six Primordial Dofus.

Against all odds… he succeeded.

He held all six Dofus in his arms. With them, he returned to Dathura, hoping to make her happy — to give her a world of dreams.

But something went wrong. The Dofus were too powerful. The energy surged. Dathura, his beloved, was killed in the chaos.

Ogrest, driven mad by grief, climbed to the highest mountain, cradled her lifeless body, and began to weep.

 The Tears That Changed the World

He cried for days. Then weeks. Then years.
His tears flooded valleys. His sobs shook mountains.

The Ogres' Tears became rivers, and then oceans. The mountain he climbed cracked, becoming the now-famous Mount Zinit.

Entire continents sank beneath waves. Cities were wiped out. Crops failed. The world changed forever.
This event would be known as Ogrest’s Chaos — the most devastating cataclysm in the World of Twelve.

 A World on the Brink

The gods were shaken. Some blamed Ogrest. Others blamed Otomaï for creating him. Mortals, too, divided. Some sought revenge. Others, redemption.
Ogrest remained at the top of Mount Zinit, crying still, unreachable, his Dofus power unchecked.

Heroes from across the land began to rise. They formed guilds. They trained to climb the mountain, hoping to stop Ogrest, save the world, or seize the Dofus for themselves.

And so began the Age of Adventurers.
